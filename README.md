SemanticKITTI dataset: http://semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html

The entire KITTI dataset is 80G. We trained on sequences 01, 02, 04, 06, 07, 10 and validated on sequence 09.

There are 6 datapoints from sequence 04 uploaded as examples. To train the model use these examples to verify code works: \
`cd tasks/semantic; 
python train.py -d path/to/dataset -ac config/arch/xxx.yaml -l path/to/log -t fake`\
To train the model use real data:\
`cd tasks/semantic; 
python train.py -d DATAPATH -ac config/arch/xxx.yaml -l path/to/log -t real`

Trained model is stored in: `tasks/semantic/path/to/log`\
Trained result is stored in tensorboard: `tasks/semantic/path/to/log/xxx_tb`
